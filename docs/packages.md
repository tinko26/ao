# Packages

The ↗️ [source code](source-code.md) of the framework consists of C files and directories containing header files. Thereby, directories and corresponding C files constitute the following three packages.

| Package     | Directories | Files        |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Port        | `ao_sys_*`  | `ao_sys_*.c` |
| Kernel      | `ao_sys`    | `ao_sys.c`   |
| Environment | `ao`        | `ao.c`       |
