# Debugging

The following modules support the debugging of an application. Especially, runtime assertions are extensively used throughout the framework.

| Module | |
|--------|-|
| [`ao_assert.h`](assert.md) | Defines a single macro function, that executes a runtime assertion. |
| [`ao_break.h`](break.md) | Defines a single function, that executes a breakpoint. |
| [`ao_debug.h`](debug.md) | Defines a single macro constant, that indicates, whether an application is running in debug mode. |
