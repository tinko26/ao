# Overview1

A binary heap is a special kind of binary tree that maintains both the shape of a complete binary tree and the heap property. The latter implies, that a node is always less than its children, with respect to a strict total order.

Both insertion into and removal from heaps take logarithmic time. This makes them a perfect choice for implementing priority queues.

The following modules implement binary heaps.

| [`ao_heap.h`](api/src/ao/ao_heap.h.md) | Pointer-based binary heaps |
| [`ao_heap4obj.h`](api/src/ao/ao_heap4obj.h.md) | Array-based binary heaps for fixed-size objects |
| [`ao_heap4ptr.h`](api/src/ao/ao_heap4ptr.h.md) | Array-based binary heaps for pointers |
