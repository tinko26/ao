# Notes

...

- Readers-writer locks preferring writers.
- That is, readers must wait until there are no more writers.

...

# Include

| [`ao_async.h`](ao_async.h.md) |
| [`ao_list.h`](../ao/ao_list.h.md) |
| [`ao_time.h`](ao_time.h.md) |

# Types

## `ao_wr_t`

```c
typedef struct ao_wr_t ao_wr_t;
```

Represents a readers-writer lock.

## `ao_wr_lock_t`

```c
typedef struct ao_wr_lock_t ao_wr_lock_t;
```

Represents the locking of a readers-writer lock.

# Structs

## `ao_wr_t`

```c
struct ao_wr_t
{
    ao_uint_t active_r;
    bool      active_w;
    ao_list_t lock_r;
    ao_list_t lock_w;
};
```

| `active_r` | The number of active readers. |
| `active_w` | Indicates whether a writer is active. |
| `lock_r` | The list of waiting readers |
| `lock_w` | The list of waiting writers. |

## `ao_wr_lock_t`

```c
struct ao_wr_lock_t
{
    ao_async_t     async;
    bool volatile  result;
    ao_wr_t *      wr;
    ao_list_node_t wr_lock_node;
};
```

| `async` | The asynchronous event. |
| `result` | The result. |
| `wr` | The readers-writer lock. |
| `wr_lock_node` | The node for the readers-writer lock's waiting lists. |

# Functions

## `ao_wr_lock_read`
## `ao_wr_lock_read_from`

```c
bool ao_wr_lock_read     (ao_wr_t * w, ao_time_t timeout);
bool ao_wr_lock_read_from(ao_wr_t * w, ao_time_t timeout, ao_time_t beginning);
```

Locks a readers-writer lock for reading in a blocking fashion with a timeout and an optional beginning.

## `ao_wr_lock_read_forever`

```c
bool ao_wr_lock_read_forever(ao_wr_t * w);
```

Locks a readers-writer lock for reading indefinitely in a blocking fashion.

## `ao_wr_lock_read_try`

```c
bool ao_wr_lock_read_try(ao_wr_t * w);
```

Locks a readers-writer lock for reading in a non-blocking fashion.

## `ao_wr_lock_read_begin`
## `ao_wr_lock_read_end`

```c
void ao_wr_lock_read_begin(ao_wr_lock_t * l);
void ao_wr_lock_read_end  (ao_wr_lock_t * l);
```

Begins or ends, respectively, a locking of a readers-writer lock for reading.

## `ao_wr_lock_write`
## `ao_wr_lock_write_from`

```c
bool ao_wr_lock_write     (ao_wr_t * w, ao_time_t timeout);
bool ao_wr_lock_write_from(ao_wr_t * w, ao_time_t timeout, ao_time_t beginning);
```

Locks a readers-writer lock for writing in a blocking fashion with a timeout and an optional beginning.

## `ao_wr_lock_write_forever`

```c
bool ao_wr_lock_write_forever(ao_wr_t * w);
```

## `ao_wr_lock_write_try`

```c
bool ao_wr_lock_write_try(ao_wr_t * w);
```

Locks a readers-writer lock for writing in a non-blocking fashion.

## `ao_wr_lock_write_begin`
## `ao_wr_lock_write_end`

```c
void ao_wr_lock_write_begin(ao_wr_lock_t * l);
void ao_wr_lock_write_end  (ao_wr_lock_t * l);
```

Begins or ends, respectively, a locking of a readers-writer lock for writing.

## `ao_wr_unlock_read`

```c
void ao_wr_unlock_read(ao_wr_t * w);
```

Unlocks a readers-writer lock for reading.

## `ao_wr_unlock_write`

```c
void ao_wr_unlock_write(ao_wr_t * w);
```

Unlocks a readers-writer lock for writing.
